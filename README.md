# Overview
This project classifies weather stations based on climate data using machine learning algorithms. Multiple models—including KNN, Decision Tree, and Neural Network—were explored to evaluate performance across varied environmental conditions. The final workflow includes preprocessing, model evaluation, and visual analytics.
# Goals
- Classify stations based on weather features
- Identify the most accurate and generalizable model
- Generate actionable visual insights
- Recommend next steps for deployment and enhancement
# Dataset
Includes meteorological features from various stations:
- Temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.
- Time-based variables for seasonal trends
- Geographic indicators for spatial context
# Methods
- Feature scaling and dimensionality reduction with PCA
- Models evaluated:
- K-Nearest Neighbor (best overall performance)
- Decision Tree
- Neural Network
- Confusion matrices and heatmaps used for assessment
# Results
- KNN demonstrated highest accuracy and stability
- Seasonal and regional variance affected model performance
- Dashboards and visuals built for easy interpretation
# Recommendations
- Deploy KNN for consistent stations
- Improve with regional models and expanded features
- Automate updates with real-time data pipelines
- Evaluate ethical considerations for model use
# Next Steps
- Explore ensemble methods
- Tune hyperparameters, apply cross-validation
- Clean and expand datasets
- Integrate stakeholder feedback
